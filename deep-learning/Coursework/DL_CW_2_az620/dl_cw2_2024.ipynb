        "* PaperSpace [guide if you need more compute](https://hackmd.io/@afspies/S1stL8Qnt)\n",
        "* Lab GPUs via SSH.  The VSCode Remote Develop extension is recommended for this. For general Imperial remote working instructions see [this post](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nuric/teaching/remote-working-for-imperial-computing-students.html). You'll also want to [setup your environment as outlined here](https://hackmd.io/@afspies/Bkd7Zq60K).\n",

You are advised to check that your implementations pass these tests (in particular, the jit saving and loading may not work for certain niche functions)\n",
