        "When working with neural networks, it's fundamental to keep in mind the **dimension**, or shape, of the tensors we're working with. Wrongly shaped tensors can break a computational graph, causing an error when using machine learning libraries. \n",
        "When we use fully connected layers, it is generally easy to keep in mind what's the output dimension of a tensor: after all, a **fully connected layer is simply a linear matrix multiplication** followed by a non-linearity. When using libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow, we explicitly specify the input dimension of the tensor, the output dimension we want, and we know what to expect as an output. \n",
        "\n",
        "Things are a bit more complicated when we use **convolutional layers**. You're probably familiar with the convolution operation done by a **convolutional filter**. A filter, say, a $(3 \\times 3)$ filter, slides over the input matrix of dimension $(m \\times n)$ (for simplicity I'm not considering the third dimensions of both the filter and the input tensor, since they are not relevant to this tutorial). How do you predict the output shape? And more importantly, how can you control the output shape to be the one you need for layers futher down in the computational graph?\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will see two parameters that allow us to change the behaviour of the convolutional filters, effectively changing the shape of the output tensor: **padding** and **stride**."

In this case, the output shape is $(2 \\times 2)$.\n",

Normally, as we saw before, the convolutional filter slides over the input matrix and moves right by one position at each step, then moves down of one position when the row is completed. At each position we apply the convolutional operation and obtain a new output number for the output tensor. To obtain a smaller shape as an output, we may decide to let the convolutional filter **slide of more than one position at each time, both horizontally and vertically**. We refer to this sliding amount as the **stride**. By default, Deep Learning libraries use a stride of 1, as we always did before, because it is the minimum movement after applying the filter at a certain position. \n",
