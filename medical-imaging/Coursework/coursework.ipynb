They performed aggressive random crops (from 0.08 <= x <= 1 of original) in area and a random aspect ratio (3/4 <= x <= 4/3) of the original aspect ratio made. Additionally a random crop + resize is followed by a random horizontal flip with 50\\% probability.\n",

I am inspired by the paper to perform a random aggressive crop of 1/16 <= x <= 1 of the original area (at the extreme, this gives a 7x7 area to process which BY EYE seems aggressive enough without loosing too much detail). Further default parameters have been kept as is.\n",

For our purpose, hue is irrelevant as we want to keep the model to learn only grey-scale features.\n",

You can use the readily available implementation in [torchmetrics](https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable/classification/auroc.html#functional-interface).
